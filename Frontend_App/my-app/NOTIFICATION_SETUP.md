# Emergency Alert Notification Setup

## Overview
This app includes a system-level emergency alert notification feature that appears in the phone's notification panel when enabled in settings.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **What Works Now (in Expo Go)**
- Settings toggle functionality
- Home screen emergency button show/hide
- All app navigation and UI
- Emergency alert flow (crime selection, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations in Expo Go**
- **System notifications don't appear in notification panel** (Expo Go limitation)
- Console logs show notification creation/cancellation for debugging
- All other functionality works perfectly

### üöÄ **Full Functionality (Development Build)**
- **Real system notifications** appear in phone's notification panel
- **Persistent emergency alert** stays in notification area
- **Tap notification** ‚Üí Opens app directly to crime selection
- **Complete system integration**

## How to Get Full Functionality

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure and build
eas build:configure
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Option 2: Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Current Behavior

### When Toggle is ON:
- ‚úÖ Home screen emergency button appears
- ‚úÖ Settings show "enabled" status
- üì± **Development Build**: System notification appears
- üîß **Expo Go**: Console log shows notification creation

### When Toggle is OFF:
- ‚úÖ Home screen emergency button disappears
- ‚úÖ Settings show "disabled" status
- üì± **Development Build**: System notification removed
- üîß **Expo Go**: Console log shows notification cancellation

## Technical Notes

- **NotificationService.js**: Handles system notification management
- **Settings**: Complete toggle functionality implemented
- **Context**: Global state management working
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of Expo Go limitations

The feature is fully implemented and will work completely once you use a development build instead of Expo Go!
